# JavaScript: Password Generator
## Welcome to my Password Generator website

When the user click on the Generator button, the user will be asked for:
- How long the password would be: the input should be between 8 - 128 characters. If the input is outside the range, the user will be asked to enter again.
- Password criteria:
  - To include numbers
  - To include uppercase
  - To include special characters (e.g. +-*/!@#$%^&*()~?:,.<>?)

Then the password will be selected randomly based on the criteria and appear on the text area.

The user can redo the process by clicking on the generate button again if not satisfied.
